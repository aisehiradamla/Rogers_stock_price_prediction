Rogers Stock Price Prediction using LSTM and Simple Moving Average



STOCK PRICE PREDICTIONS

Investors have access to a vast array of resources to aid them in making sound investment decisions. These include market and economic data, stock charts, industry and company characteristics, as well as a wealth of financial statistical data. However, in a capitalistic economic system, it is challenging to predict market performance due to several factors, such as the psychological, rational and irrational behaviors towards physical factors, government policies, and most significantly, people's irrational desire for greater gains. These factors make share prices highly volatile and challenging to forecast accurately. While all the data can offer a valuable perspective in the investment process, it's important to recognize that human behavior and expectations also play a crucial role in investment outcomes.
